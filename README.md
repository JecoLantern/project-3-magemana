# Mage-Manager
A fifth edition dungeons and dragons character generator. The app aims to help new and old players to build a character of their choice. It is a complete character generator that will allow players to not only store their characters but also track their stats and in the future will allow D&D parties to host and play their entire sessions within our app.
